        <p class="author">- By Percy Bysshe Shelley</p>

        <div class="poem">
            <p>I met a traveler from an antique land</p>
            <p>Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone</p>
            <p>Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,</p>
            <p>Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,</p>
            <p>And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,</p>
            <p>Tell that its sculptor well those passions read</p>
            <p>Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,</p>
            <p>The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed.</p>
            <p>And on the pedestal, these words appear:</p>
            <p>My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;</p>
            <p>Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!</p>
            <p>Nothing beside remains. Round the decay</p>
            <p>Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare</p>
            <p>The lone and level sands stretch far away.</p>
